        "Both involve estimating an unknown probability based on observed outcomes. In each case, we use a likelihood to show how likely different values are given the data, and we combine that with a prior to form a posterior that updates our belief. Both also show how more data increases our confidence in the estimate. The marble example has a small, finite number of possible outcomes (like 0-4 red marbles), while Wembanyama's true free throw percentage is continuous between 0 and 1. Marble draws are perfectly independent with replacement, whereas free throws may be influenced by fatigue, pressure, etc. Priors in the marble example can be counted exactly based on how the factory makes the bags, but Wembanyama's prior comes from his previous Euroleague performance and is more subjective.\n"
